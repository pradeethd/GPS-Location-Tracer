# GPS-Location-Tracer
Get location of the target (accurate to GPS) using PHP log.

The index.html file is a fake Cloudflare redirect site from my another project (https://github.com/pradeethd/Fake-Cloudflare) which redirects to your target site.
(You can replace it)

The script can **only get** the location of the target if it is **allowed** by them.

The location of the target** (or) the error is stored in the log.txt file for each successful attack.

Thanks for using my project.
